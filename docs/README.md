# Documentation for Oliver and his Olives
## by David, Kyle, Marshall and Oliver for CIT 481 Cal State Northridge, 2021

## About

This is our documentation for how we have been deploying and completing our project. This includes operational activities to technical activities that we are able to describe. Sometimes, there may be dragons that we cannot catch and document. But we do our best.

## Project and operational activities

Projects are carried out as a means of achieving the strategic objectives of our group and are considered beyond the normal operation of the group. We are making a Rocket Chat instance. However, operations are the ongoing and routine activities included in the core project of our group. This includes work such as git management, task management, testing production, resource delivery, automation etc. As such, operations encompass all of "normal" group functions.
