#These configurations should be placed in ~/.ssh/config on your LOCAL MACHINE
#This is to make aliases so that you can easily SSH into your SSH Bastion, or to technically bypass the Bastion

HOST myBastion
  IdentityFile [/path/to/pemfile]
  User ubuntu
  Hostname [PUBLIC IP OF SSH BASTION]
  
#Now for the next host, you will want to use the private ip of the host in your VPC you are trying to access
#For example, if Prometheus is your target machine, enter the private ip of that machine

HOST [TARGET'S PRIVATE IP]
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile [/path/to/pemfile]
  ProxyCommand ssh myBastion -W %h:%p
  
  #Repeat for as many target machines exist on your VPC
  #Now if you simply run "ssh [TARGET'S PRIVATE IP]", you will be able to bypass the jumpbox, and log straight into your desired machine
  
  #NOTE: Be sure that your VPC subnets do not conflict with your own local network
